        <p>
            My name is Alana Keay and I am 25 years old. I joined the navy within a month of graduating high school. I joined the navy and became a helicopter mechanic and was able to travel around the world for a little bit. When my 4 years can to a close I decided that I needed a change and got out just in time to become a stay-at-home mom while going to school at Full Sail online full time. I think I have found a good balance in my life with trying to push myself with learning something I have always had an interest doing. When in high school I was in charge of designing my high school ROTC website. It has always been an interest to me but now I am able to learn to do design and develop for a living. When I was going up everyone said to find something you love to do and you will never have to work a day in your life. I do not know if it is true but I am willing to try.

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p> The target audience for this page layout is ages 28-40. The sections are styled to make me assume the restaurant is at the higher end of the scale.</p>
            <h3>Client/Users Needs</h3>

            <h3>Critique</h3>
            <p> The choice of color makes me think of a high end more elegant restaurant. The images in the background are example of cuisine that is serviced. Information is displayed in boxes that you can still see the images behind and read the text clearly. When you hover over the buttons they change to a littler color. The text on the white boxes are little hard to read because the text is just a little bit darker then the background. </p>

The color scheme is white black and green which also makes me think they are going for an elegant but fun appearance. The website uses icons at the bottom of the images as buttons. The text is a little hard to read when you get to the paragraphs but the headings are bold and are easy to read. The text seems a little squished and overwhelming at first. </p>
